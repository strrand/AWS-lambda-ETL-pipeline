# AWS-lambda-ETL-pipeline
This repository showcases an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using AWS Lambda and S3. The data is extracted from a HistoricalCrypto API using Python, and subsequently loaded into an AWS S3 bucket for storage and further processing.
After this I also visualized the data using AWS SageMaker and Jupyter notebook.

## Files in the Repository:
lambda_function.py: This is the main Python script that contains the Lambda function used to extract data from the HistoricalCrypto API and store it in the S3 bucket.

crypto-visualization: This is my notebook to visualize the Crypto historical trend with python. The data have been loaded from my S3 bucket containing the raw data.
